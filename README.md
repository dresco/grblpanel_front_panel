# grblPANEL front panel

KiCad implemenation of the front panel for a grblPANEL reference design.

The geometry for the panel is generated in OpenSCAD (repository [here](https://github.com/dresco/grblpanel_front_panel_openscad)), and is
suitable for either 3d printing, or as the basis for a PCB based front panel.

The edge cuts layer was imported from the OpenSCAD DXF file, with silkscreen
added natively within KiCad.
